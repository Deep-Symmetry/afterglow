Since I have been too busy working on the software to get out and
perform with it, I was deeply grateful to
https://github.com/dandaka[Vlad Rafeev] for getting this page started
by sharing a video of a
https://www.facebook.com/deepowerband/[Deepower audiovisual] show he
lit using Afterglow in Kaliningrad, in December, 2015. He modestly
says, “My first experience with lights, still a lot to accomplish.”
And I say, there is a ton left to implement in the software too. But
it was fun to see the great video he shared, but it is sadly no longer
online.

For a more wordy and nerdy introduction, there is a video of my
