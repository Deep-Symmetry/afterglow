Dynamic parameters provide a way to turn a simple cue into something
which changes over time and space, or reacts to operator input. Most
cues which take simple values can also take dynamic parameters which
evaluate to those values.

== Frame Dynamic Parameters

When creating a dynamic parameter, you can control _how_ dynamic it is.
The most dynamic, __frame dynamic__, are evaluated anew for every single
frame of control values that are sent out to the lights. If, on the
other hand, you want the value to be calculated when the effect is
started, and then stay constant, you can create the parameter with a
`false` value for `frame-dynamic?`

== Variable Parameters

Parameters can get their values from a __show variable__. Any number of
values can be stored in the show, by assigning them a keyword with the
function:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.show/set-variable! :key value)
----

TIP: In addition to manually setting values in show variables, you can
use <<mapping_sync#mapping-a-control-to-a-variable,MIDI mappings>> to
have them set by turning a knob or sliding a fader on a MIDI control
surface. <<cues.adoc#cues,Cues>> can also set variables, and can bind
them to encoders or pressure sensitive pads on controllers like the
<<mapping_sync#using-ableton-push,Ableton Push>>.

You can then refer to that stored value whenever you are creating a
dynamic parameter by simply using the keyword (in this example, `:key`),
and the current value stored in the show variable will be used. This is
a convenience mechanism, you can also explicitly build a reference to a
show variable like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-variable-param :key)
----

The reason you might want to use the explicit creation function is that
you can control details about the binding by passing in optional keyword
parameters:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:type` |`Number` |The type of value that is expected in the variable

|`:default` |`0` |The value to assign the parameter if the variable is
missing or has the wrong type

|`:assign-fn` |none |If supplied, is called with the value of the show
variable, and its return value is used as the value of the parameter

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the variable value should be looked
at at every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

As an example of using these parameters, consider:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-variable-param :key
  :type Number :default 0 :adjust-fn #(* % 2))
----

This would cause the dynamic parameter to have a numeric value which is
twice the value found in the show variable.

When you use the keyword shorthand to bind to a show variable in
building another dynamic parameter, the type and default are assumed
from the context in which you are using the variable.

== Oscillated Parameters

Oscillated parameters vary over time, at a speed controlled by a
<<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>> (usually the main show metronome,
synced to DJ equipment) and so can make the lights appear to be
reacting intelligently to the music being played. The timing
information produced by the metronome is fed into an
<<oscillators#oscillators,Oscillator>>, which determines the shape of
the wave that controls its value, and the frequency at which it
oscillates, related to beats, bars, or phrases of the underlying
metronome. The resulting value can then be scaled to meet the needs of
whatever is being generated (a dimmer level, color component, or light
rotation). Oscillated parameters are created by calling
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.oscillators.html#var-build-oscillated-param[afterglow.effects.oscillators/build-oscillated-param].


[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.oscillators/build-oscillated-param oscillator)
----

The `oscillator` parameter is an
<<oscillators#oscillators,Oscillator>> created by one of the functions
in
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.oscillators.html[afterglow.effects.oscillators]
which, as described above, determines how to react to the time
information provided by the metronome. Additionally, you can supply
one of the following optional keyword parameters:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:min` |`0` |The smallest value that the oscillated parameter will be
assigned

|`:max` |`255` |The largest value that the oscillated parameter will be
assigned

|`:metronome` |none |If supplied, is used instead of the main show
metronome

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

The keyword parameters `:min`, `:max`, and `:metronome` can themselves
be bound to show variables by passing in the keyword with which the show
variable was created. The frame-dynamic setting of such variable
bindings will be controlled by the frame-dynamic setting of the
oscillated parameter being created.

== Step Parameters

Like oscillated parameters (above), step parameters vary over time, at
a speed controlled by a <<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>> (usually
the main show metronome, synced to DJ equipment). But rather than
moving back and forth, step parameters increase steadily over time,
because they are designed to control the progression of a
<<effects#chases,chase>>. Step parameters are created by calling
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-step-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param].

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param)
----

With no arguments, this creates a step parameter that starts out with
the value `1` for the duration of the beat closest to when you created
it, and the value will jump up by one as each subsequent beat occurs:

image:assets/step-fade-0.png[Default Step Parameter]

If a less-abrupt transition between stages in the chase is desired, a
fade can be added between them by passing a value with the optional
keyword argument `:fade-fraction`. When omitted, the default value is
`0`, meaning no time is spent fading, which results in the kind of
abrupt steps seen in the graph above. Passing a value of `0.2` would
cause the parameter to spend 1/5 of its time fading: During the final
0.1 of the beat, it would ramp up towards the midpoint of the next
value, and then finish that ramp during the first 0.1 of the next
beat, as shown in the following graph:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param :fade-fraction 0.2)
----

image:assets/step-fade-0-2.png[Step Parameter with fade fraction 0.2]

The graph shows that most of each beat is spent with the step
parameter steady at its expected value, but the first and last tenths
are a linear fade from and to the next value. Changing the fade
fraction to 0.5 causes half the time to be spent fading, and only half
sitting at the beat's assigned value:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param :fade-fraction 0.5)
----

image:assets/step-fade-0-5.png[Step Parameter with fade fraction 0.5]

That trend continues until the maximum possible fade-fraction value of
`1` is used, which causes all of each beat to be spent fading, so the
step parameter continuously fades through values, reaching the value
assigned to a given beat at the midpoint of that beat:


[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param :fade-fraction 1)
----

image:assets/step-fade-1.png[Step Parameter with fade fraction 1]

In addition to linear fades, you can smooth out the start and end of
the fades by using a sine-shaped fade curve, by passing the optional
keyword argument `:fade-curve` with the value `:sine`. Here is what
that looks like with a continuous fade:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param :fade-curve :sine :fade-fraction 1)
----

image:assets/step-sine-fade-1.png[Step Parameter with sine curve and fade fraction 1]

The smoothing effect of the sine curve option becomes even more
evident when you configure the step parameter to fade for only part of
the beat:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param :fade-curve :sine :fade-fraction 0.5)
----

image:assets/step-sine-fade-0-5.png[Step Parameter with sine curve and fade fraction 0.5]

Of course, as the amount of time spent fading gets compressed, the
smoothing is less obvious, although it is still there. Dropping back
to fading over just the first and last tenth of the beat looks like
this:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param :fade-curve :sine :fade-fraction 0.2)
----

image:assets/step-sine-fade-0-2.png[Step Parameter with sine curve and fade fraction 0.2]

When the fade fraction is `0`, it does not matter what the fade curve
is, because no fading takes place.

You can also have the step parameter increment for each bar or phrase,
rather than each beat, by passing the optional keyword argument
`:interval` with the value `:bar` or `:phrase`.

And if you would like the beat numbers to be counted from a time that
is different than when you created the step parameter, you can pass a
metronome snapshot along with the keyword argument `:starting`, and
beats will be counted so that the first beat is the one that occured
closest to that snapshot.

== Color Parameters

Color parameters are an extremely flexible way of dynamically assigning
color. The basic way to create one is to call
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-color-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-color-param].

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-color-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic black color.
However, you will use one or more of the following optional keyword
parameters to get the dynamic color you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:color` |black |The base, starting color of this dynamic color

|`:r` |`0` |Red brightness, from 0 to 255

|`:g` |`0` |Green brightness, from 0 to 255

|`:b` |`0` |Blue brightness, from 0 to 255

|`:h` |`0.0` |Hue value, from 0.0 to 360.0

|`:s` |`0.0` |Saturaion value, from 0.0 to 100.0

|`:l` |`0.0` |Lightness value, from 0.0 to 100.0

|`:adjust-hue` |`0.0` |Hue shift value, from -360.0 to 360.0

|`:adjust-saturation` |`0.0` |Saturation shift value, from -100.0 to
100.0

|`:adjust-lightness` |`0.0` |Lightness shift value, from -100.0 to 100.0

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

Refer to <<color#working-with-color,Working with Color>> for a
refresher on the meaning of the basic color components. It would not
make sense to pass all of these parameters, because some will override
others, but here is how they are evaluated:

. The base color is established by the `:color` parameter.

. If any of `:r`, `:g`, or `:b` have been supplied, the color is
replaced by creating an RGB color with the values (or defaults)
supplied.

. If any of `:h`, `:s`, or `:l` have been supplied, the color is
replaced by creating an HSL color with the values (or defaults)
supplied.

. If `:adjust-hue` was supplied, the hue of the color obtained so far
is shifted by adding that amount to it (and wrapping around the color
circle if needed).

. If `adjust-saturation` was supplied, the saturation of the color is
adjusted by adding that amount to it, maxing out at 100.0, and bottoming
out at 0.0. Lower saturations yield less colorful (more gray) colors.

. If `adjust-lightness` was supplied, the lightness of the color is
adjusted by adding that amount to it, maxing out at 100.0, and bottoming
out at 0.0. A lightness of 50.0 allows for a fully saturated color,
lightnesses above that start getting whitened, and a lightness of 100.0
is pure white; lightnesses below 50.0 start getting darkened, and a
lightness of 0.0 is pure black.

Finally, the result of all this is the color that is returned by the
dynamic parameter. Afterglow tries to be as efficient about this as
possible, and do as much calculation as it can when the parameter is
created. If there are no frame dynamic parameters, it will return a
fixed color. But you can easily use frame-dynamic oscillated
parameters and get lovely shifting rainbow cues, as shown in the
<<effects#oscillator-effects,effect examples>>.

== Movement

There are three different kinds of parameters which tell fixtures how
to move. They differ in the way that you express direction or aim.

=== Direction Parameters

Direction parameters are one way to tell a group of fixtures to point
in a particular _direction_, or move in unison or in a coordinated
pattern. They are used with <<effects#direction-effects,Direction
Effects>>. (<<parameters#pan-tilt-parameters,Pan Tilt Parameters>> and
<<effects#pan-tilt-effects,Pan/Tilt Effects>> are the other way to
achieve that result.) The basic way to create a direction parameter is
to call
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-direction-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-direction-param].


[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-direction-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic direction telling
fixtures to point directly at the audience. However, you will use one or
more of the following optional keyword parameters to get the dynamic
direction you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:x` |`0` |The amount the light should point towards audience’s right

|`:y` |`0` |The amount the light should point up

|`:z` |`1` |The amount the light should point towards the audience

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

Collectively, `x`, `y`, and `z` specify a three-dimensional vector in
the light show’s <<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>> telling
the lights which direction they should point. The absolute magnitudes
of the values are not important, it is their relative sizes that
matter. The default of `[0, 0, 1]` means the lights point neither left
nor right, neither up nor down, and straight towards the audience.
`[1, 0, 0]` would be straight right, `[-1, 0, 0]` straight left, `[0,
1, 0]` straight up, and `[0, 1, -1]` up and away from the audience at
a 45° angle. When this vector is supplied to a
<<effects#direction-effects,Direction Effect>>, it causes the attached
lights to make the specified movement, if they are capable.

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

=== Aim Parameters

Aim parameters are a way to tell a group of fixtures to aim at a
particular _point_ in space, or track something in unison or in a
coordinated pattern. They are used with <<effects#aim-effects,Aim
Effects>>. The basic way to create one is to call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-aim-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic point telling
fixtures to aim directly at a height of zero, centered on the X axis,
two meters towards the audience. However, you will use one or more of
the following optional keyword parameters to get the dynamic target
point you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:x` |`0` |How many meters along the X axis the target point is found

|`:y` |`0` |How high up or down the Y axis is the target point

|`:z` |`2` |How far towards or away from the audience is the target
point

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

Collectively, `x`, `y`, and `z` specify a three-dimensional point
within the light show’s <<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>> telling the
lights where to aim. When this vector is supplied to an
<<effects#aim-effects,Aim Effect>>, it causes the attached lights to
make the specified movement, if they are capable.

If you need to convert inches or feet to meters, which are the
standard distance units in Afterglow, you can use
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.transform.html#var-inches[afterglow.transform/inches]
and
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.transform.html#var-feet[afterglow.transform/feet].

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

=== Pan Tilt Parameters

A more traditional way of aiming fixtures (in contrast to
<<parameters#direction-parameters,Direction Parameters>>) involves
setting pan and tilt angles. Afterglow supports this approach as well,
although even in this case you use angles expressed in the standard
show <<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>> regardless of how
the individual fixtures are hung. Pan Tilt parameters work with
<<effects#pan-tilt-effects,Pan/Tilt Effects>>. The basic way to
create one is to call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-pan-tilt-param)
----

By itself this call would simply return a non-dynamic pan-tilt
parameter telling fixtures to point directly at the audience. However,
you will use one or more of the following optional keyword parameters
to get the dynamic angles you want:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:pan` |`0` |How many degrees counter-clockwise should the light turn
around the Y axis

|`:tilt` |`0` |How many degrees counter-clockwise should the light turn
around the X axis

|`:radians`|`false` |Supply a `true` value with `:radians` if you
would rather work in radians than degrees for your `:pan` and `:tilt`
values.

|`:frame-dynamic` |`true` |Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once
|=======================================================================

The rotations requested by `pan` and `tilt` jointly identify the
direction the light should turn away from the audience. The result of
the parameter is a pair of pan and tilt angles away from the `z` axis
of the light show’s <<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>>
telling the lights which direction they should point. When this parameter
is supplied to a <<effects#pan-tilt-effects,Pan/Tilt Effect>>, it
causes the attached lights to make the specified movement, if they are
capable.

Note that although internally Afterglow works with angles expressed in
radians, the values of `pan` and `tilt` are assumed to be in degrees
and will be converted to radians for the convenience of users who are
more accustomed to working with angles expressed in degrees. If you
would rather stick with radians, you can suppress this conversion by
passing a `true` value with the `:radians` keyword.

All of these parameters, except for `frame-dynamic`, can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>.

NOTE: You can also create a direction parameter using pan and tilt
angles if you want to work with <<effects#direction-effects,Direction
Effects>> in those terms. This can be helpful, for example, when you
want to fade between a specific direction that is easiest to express
as a spatial vector, and one that is easiest to express in terms of
angles. Use
[build-direction-from-pan-tilt](http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-direction-param-from-pan-tilt)
to create a normal direction parameter starting from the same pan/tilt
parameters described above.


== Spatial Parameters

Spatial parameters allow you to base an effect parameter on the physical
arrangement or relationships between fixtures in your light show. The
way to create one is to call
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-spatial-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-spatial-param].

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.params/build-spatial-param fixtures-or-heads f)
----

The required parameters are the fixtures and/or heads over which you
want this parameter to be calculated, and a function which, when invoked
with a fixture or head, returns a number or a dynamic `Number`
parameter.

If desired, the results returned for all included heads can be scaled
to fall within a standard range. Scaling is activated using the
optional keyword parameters `:max` and `:min`. If neither is supplied,
scaling is not performed. Passing a value for only `:max` activates
scaling with a default minimum value of `0`, and passing a value for
only `:min` activates scaling with a default maximum value of `255`.
The maximum value must be larger than the minimum value.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:min` | n/a | If present, activates result scaling, and establishes
the smallest value this dynamic parameter will hold.
|`:max` | n/a | If present, activates result scaling, and establishes
the largest value this dynamic parameter will hold.
|`:frame-dynamic` |n/a | Whether the parameter should be calculated at
every frame, or just once.
|=======================================================================

As noted above, the values returned by `f` can themselves be
dynamic parameters, such as show <<variable-parameters,variables>>
(with the convenience shorthand of just passing in the keyword by which
the show variable was stored) or <<oscillated-parameters,oscillated
parameters>>. If `frame-dynamic` is not explicitly set, the spatial
parameter will be frame dynamic if any value returned by `f` is
frame-dynamic.

Useful things that `f` can do include calculating the distance of the
head from some point, either in 3D or along an axis, its angle from
some line, and so on. These can allow the creation of lighting
gradients across all or part of a show. Spatial parameters make
excellent building blocks for <<color-parameters,color>>,
<<direction-parameters,direction>> and <<aim-parameters,aim>>
parameters, as shown in the
<<effects#spatial-effects,effect examples>>.
