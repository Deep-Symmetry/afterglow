Metronomes play a fundamental role in coordinating the timing of
Afterglow’s effects, and helping them relate to musical structure. They
keep track of musical time relative to some starting point, in terms of
beats, bars (by default four beats to a bar), and phrases (usually eight
bars to a phrase). In addition to keeping track of the current beat,
bar, and phrase, metronomes can also tell you the _phase_ of that beat,
bar, or phrase, which is a measurement of progress through the beat,
bar, or phrase. The phase starts out at 0.0 at the very beginning of the
interval, and grows towards, but never quite reaches, 1.0, because at
that point you have moved on to phase 0.0 of the following interval.

Metronomes are generally combined with
<<oscillators#oscillators,Oscillators>> to generate wave shapes which
drive the parameters sent to lights, creating color shifts, brightness
pulses, or movements.

Since they are so important, there is always a metronome associated
with a show in Afterglow. It gets created when the show is created,
and is used for the show’s timing unless you create a separate
metronome and explicitly tell an effect to use it (which you might
want to do if that effect is to run at a very different speed than the
music). The main show metronome can be
<<mapping_sync#midi-mapping-and-beat-sync,synchronized>> to external
timing sources, such as DJ controllers and mixers, to keep the light
show tightly in time with the music being played. You can access the
the main show’s metronome through the `:metronome` keyword in the show
map, for example:

[source,clojure]
----
(:metronome *show*)
----

To create a separate metronome, you call:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.rhythm/metronome bpm)
----

The `bpm` parameter tells the metronome what tempo to use, that is, how
many beats happen per minute. You can also adjust the number of beats
which make up a bar (or measure), and how many bars make up a phrase:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===================================================
|Parameter |Default |Purpose
|`:bpb` |`4` |How many beats make up a bar (measure)
|`:bpp` |`8` |How many bars make up a phrase
|===================================================

The metronome starts counting from the moment it was created, and you
can ask it for all the counts as a string by calling:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.rhythm/metro-marker (:metronome *show*))
; -> "15.1.4"
----

TIP: This is used by the <<mapping_sync#using-ableton-push,Ableton
Push controller mapping>> to display the metronome state and support
beat jumping.

For that metronome, the current count was phrase 15, bar 1, beat 4. You
can determine those values as individual numbers as well, but you might
end up with confusing results because time is moving on while you are
calling the individual functions to ask for information, and you might
be on a different beat, bar, or phrase for a later call than an earlier
one. So the way to start is by asking the Metronome for a
_http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.rhythm.html#var-ISnapshot[snapshot]_
of its state at an instant in time, and then ask the snapshot for the
individual pieces of information you want. Afterglow does this when it
starts generating a frame of lighting effects, to make sure that all the
effects share the same notion of the point at which they are being
rendered, and create a consistent look:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.rhythm/metro-snapshot (:metronome *show*))
; -> #afterglow.rhythm.MetronomeSnapshot{:start 1431727332206, :bpm 120, :bpb 4, :bpp 8,
;    :instant 1431727683636, :beat 703, :bar 176, :phrase 22,
;    :beat-phase 0.8600000000000136, :bar-phase 0.7150000000000034,
;    :phrase-phase 0.9643750000000004}
----

Although this captures all of the information, it is not necessarily in
the format you want it, for example the beat number and bar number are
counted since the start of the metronome, and you usually want them
since the start of the bar or phrase. The snapshot has ways of providing
this information:

[source,clojure]
----
(def snap (afterglow.rhythm/metro-snapshot (:metronome *show*)))
; -> #'afterglow.examples/snap

snap
; -> #afterglow.rhythm.MetronomeSnapshot{:start 1431727332206, :bpm 120, :bpb 4, :bpp 8,
;    :instant 1431727967069, :beat 1270, :bar 318, :phrase 40, :beat-phase 0.7260000000001128,
;    :bar-phase 0.4315000000000282, :phrase-phase 0.6789375000000035}

(:beat snap)
; -> 1270

(afterglow.rhythm/snapshot-beat-within-bar snap)
; -> 2
----

Since the notion of a “down beat” (the first beat in a bar) is important
in music and thus potentially to lighting effects, there is a snapshot
function for checking that, too:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.rhythm/snapshot-down-beat? snap)
; -> false
----

____
The second beat is not the down beat.
____

The metronome can be restarted at a particular beat by calling
`metro-start` with a beat number. (Calling it with no argument returns
the time at which the metronome was started.) This can be useful to
resynchronize the metronome to the music if it has drifted, either
because there is no BPM synchronization in place, or if MIDI clock sync
is being used, and it’s been a long time, since that can drift, unlike
Pro DJ Link sync:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.rhythm/metro-start (:metronome *show*) 1)
; -> 1431727642086
----

____
The new metronome start timestamp is returned.
____

If the beats are landing in the right place but the notion of the down
beat (bar start) or phrase start is wrong, you can reset those by
calling `metro-bar-start` or `metro-phrase-start` with the desired bar
or phrase number (usually 1). These adjust the metronome so the larger
intervals are resynchronized without changing the individual beats
themselves.

The metronome’s tempo (beats per minute) can be determined or changed by
calling `metro-bpm`. Without an argument it returns the current BPM, and
an argument is used as the new BPM value. The same can be done with the
beats per bar (`metro-bpb`) and beats per phrase (`metro-bpp`).

There are a number of other functions which can be called on metronomes
and snapshots. The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.rhythm.html#var-IMetronome[IMetronome]
and
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.rhythm.html#var-ISnapshot[ISnapshot]
protocols in
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.rhythm.html[afterglow.rhythm]
specify and describe them.

== Watching Metronomes

To help get a feeling for exactly what your metronome is doing, there is
an effect that flashes one bright color on the down beat, and
another less-bright color on the rest of the beats. Running this while
you change the metronome BPM, sync, beats per bar, and such can help
drive a more visceral understanding. To run it for the main show
metronome, you can do this:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'afterglow.effects.fun)
(show/add-effect! :color
  (afterglow.effects.fun/metronome-effect *show*
    (show/all-fixtures *show*)))
----

If you want to watch a different metronome, the invocation looks like
this:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/set-variable :my-metro (afterglow.rhythm/metronome 50))
(require 'afterglow.effects.fun)
(show/add-effect! :color
  (afterglow.effects.fun/metronome-effect *show*
    (show/all-fixtures) :metronome :my-metro))
----

____
The lights are pulsing sedately...
____

[source,clojure]
----
(metro-bpm (show/get-variable :my-metro) 400)
----

____
...and now they are almost seizure-worthy!
____
