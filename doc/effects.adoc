Effects determine what a light or group of lights are doing at a given
moment in time.

== Overview

When creating an effect, you assign one or more
<<fixture_definitions#fixture-definitions,Fixtures>> to it, and it
will generate control values for only those fixtures. The fixture
channels affected by the effect depend on the kind of effect it is,
and are grouped into several primary categories. The simplest kinds of
effects apply to a single channel per fixture, or perhaps per head, if
the fixture has multiple independent light-emitting heads. A very
common single-channel effect is the <<dimmer-effects,dimmer effect>>.

Many effects assign <<color-effects,colors>> to lights, which often
involves multiple channels. RGB fixtures will use three channels, one
each for the red, green, and blue levels which make up the color. Some
fixtures add other LED colors, such as amber, white, and even
ultraviolet. Other fixtures simply use a rotating color wheel to pick
from a fixed set of colors, using a single channel. Regardless of how
the color is finally produced, at most stages of effect processing,
Afterglow works in terms of the
<<working_with_color#working-with-color,color itself>>, allowing you
to blend, lighten, darken, shift hue, and the like so you can produce
interesting looks, without regard to details of fixture
implementation. It is only at the
<<rendering_loop#the-rendering-loop,final rendering stage>> that the
color is broken down into channel assignments.

Another important category of effects control the
<<direction-effects,direction>> of moving-head fixtures. These work in
terms of a desired 3D direction vector or <<aim-effects,target point>>
with respect to the <<show_space#show-space,show frame of reference>>,
and at the last stage of rendering, convert that to pan and tilt
channel values, with reference to the angle at which the fixture has
actually been hung.

You can also conveniently use features which are shared by a number of
fixtures, or completely unique to a single fixture, through
<<function-effects,function effects>>, or drop right down to the
level of individual DMX channel values with
<<channel-effects,channel effects>>.

Finally, Afterglow includes some examples of how to build up
<<complex-effects,special-purpose effects>>, which can be fun in
themselves, and also serve as templates and inspiration for whole new
kinds of effects you create on your own.

== Effect Types

Effects in afterglow are divided by the aspect of a light that they
control. Not all fixtures have features which allow them to
participate in all kinds of effects. Afterglow effects will
simply ignore fixtures which are unable to reapond to them.

=== Dimmer Effects

Dimmer effects set the basic brightness level of a fixture. To create
an effect that will set the dimmer level of a fixture, use:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.dimmer/dimmer-effect level fixtures)
----

This effect finds all the dimmer channels associated with the
specified fixtures (there may be multiple, if the fixture has more
than one light-emitting head), and assigns them a level. 0 is off, 255
is maximum brightness. Dimmer effects can work with either fully
dedicated dimmer channels (in which case the channel itself has a
`:type` of `:dimmer`, and the entire DMX range is used for dimming),
or multipurpose channels in which a subset of the DMX range is
assigned to a function of type `:dimmer`, and the channel `:type` is
something else.

If `htp?` is true, uses highest-takes-precedence rules when replacing
any earlier or lower-priority effects which attempted to set this
particular dimmer in the current rendering cycle. In other words, if
an earlier effect chose a higher value, let it win, otherwise use the
value this effect wants.

The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.dimmer.html#var-dimmer-effect[API
documentation] also identifies two optional keyword arguments you can
pass. If `:htp?` passed with a `false`, value this effect will simply
overwrite any previous assignments it finds for the dimmers it is
controlling. Omitting `:htp?` is the same as passing it with a `true`
value. And you can change the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.dimmer.html#var-master[master]
that scales the dimmer value by passing one along with `:master`. If
you do not, the effect will be tied directly to the show's grand
master.

TIP: If you want your dimmer cue to affect only one head of a fixture, you
can pass it just that head, rather than the entire fixture.

For some fixtures, generally those with a single, white light source,
the dimmer is the only thing that determines the amount of light output.
For color-mixing fixtures like RGB LED lights, each color channel has
its own separate brightness level, and then dimmer scales the actual
output of the light, so the final brightness will be a combination of
both. In other words, if the red channel is set to 50% brightness, and
the dimmer is also set to 50% brightness, the final red output will be
at 25% brightness.

In addition to passing in a literal number for the `level` parameter,
you can pass a <<parameters#dynamic-parameters,Dynamic Parameter>>
whose value depends on a <<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>>, the
physical location or orientation of the head, or a show variable,
perhaps <<mapping_sync#mapping-a-control-to-a-variable,bound>> to a
MIDI control surface. It often makes sense to use
<<parameters#oscillated-parameters,oscillated parameters>> with dimmer
cues.

TIP: If you have color effects running for a light and you aren’t seeing
anything, make sure you have a dimmer effect setting the dimmer to some
visible level.

=== Color Effects

One of the most common basic effects you will be using to create the
looks you want is the color effect. To create an effect that will
assign a color to a fixture (which will assign colors to all of the
fixture’s heads), or a single head of a fixture, pass the fixture or
head to
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.color.html#var-color-effect[color-effect]:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.color/color-effect name color fixtures)
----

The `name` parameter is intended to help identify the purpose of the
effect, and shows up when examining the created effect. Put something
descriptive in there, or use a helper function like
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.examples.html#var-global-color-effect[afterglow.examples/global-color-effect]
which builds the effect for you, figuring out a reasonable name in
many cases.

The `color` parameter is where you specify the color to assign to the
lights. It should be a color object returned by one of the factories
in the https://github.com/jolby/colors[jolby/colors] library, as
described in <<color#working-with-color,Working with Color>>.

In addition to passing in a color for the `color` parameter,
you can pass a <<parameters#dynamic-parameters,Dynamic Parameter>>
whose value depends on a <<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>>, the
physical location or orientation of the head, or a show variable,
perhaps <<mapping_sync#mapping-a-control-to-a-variable,bound>> to a
MIDI control surface. The flexibility offered by
<<parameters#color-parameters,dynamic color parameters>> is huge,
especially when combined with
<<parameters#oscillated-parameters,oscillated parameters>>. Learning
how to effectively leverage these in combination with each other will
enable you to create most of the basic lighting looks you need.

The following code creates a effect that assigns a pure red color to
all fixtures with RGB channels, then adds it to the current show under
the keyword `:color`:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color (afterglow.effects.color/color-effect
                          "Plain red" (create-color "red") (show/all-fixtures)))
----

TIP: Remember that if aren’t seeing anything when you have assigned color
effects to a fixture to make sure you also have a dimmer effect setting
that fixture’s dimmer to some visible level.

You can also assign colors to lights that use color wheels instead of
RGB mixing by passing a `true` value with the optional keyword
argument `:include-color-wheels?` to `color-effect`. Afterglow will
try to find a color wheel position which is close enough to the
desired color, and if one can be found, tell the light to use it.

You can assign different color effects to different set of fixtures.
Following example will assign red color on odd fixtures and blue color on
even fixtures. You need to use this code inside cue or use `end-effect!`.

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color (afterglow.effects/scene "Different colors"
  (afterglow.effects.color/color-effect
    "Plain red" (create-color "red") (show/fixtures-named "odd"))
  (afterglow.effects.color/color-effect
    "Plain Blue" (create-color "blue") (show/fixtures-named "even"))
  ))
----

To achieve the same effect inside a cue:

[source,clojure]
----
(ct/set-cue! (:cue-grid *show*) 0 17
  (cues/cue :color  (fn [_] (afterglow.effects/scene
    "Blue and red 2"
      (afterglow.effects.color/color-effect
        "Plain red" (create-color "red") (show/fixtures-named "odd"))
      (afterglow.effects.color/color-effect
        "Plain Blue" (create-color "blue") (show/fixtures-named "even"))
  ))))
----

=== Direction Effects

Moving-head fixtures can create particularly exciting and dynamic shows.
To create an effect that will tell a fixture or head what direction it
should be pointing, pass the fixture or head to:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.movement/direction-effect name direction fixtures)
----

The `name` parameter is intended to help identify the purpose of the
effect, and shows up when examining the created effect.

The `direction` parameter is where you specify the direction the
lights should be pointing. It is a `javax.vector.Vector3d` pointing in
the direction the lights should face, with respect to the show’s
<<show_space#show-space,frame of reference>>. An easy way to create
one is to call
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-direction-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-direction-param] or
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-direction-param-from-pan-tilt[afterglow.effects.params/build-direction-param-from-pan-tilt].
These can create static vectors for you, but can also create
<<parameters#dynamic-parameters,Dynamic Parameters>> whose value
depends on a <<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>>, the physical
location or orientation of the head, or a show variable, perhaps
<<mapping_sync#mapping-a-control-to-a-variable,bound>>
to a MIDI control surface. Building dynamic direction parameters with
<<parameters#oscillated-parameters,oscillated parameters>> can
create fascinating motions.

If a group of fixtures is assigned the same direction effect, they
will all face the same direction. If they are assigned the same aim
effect (below), they will all face slightly different directions in
order to aim at the same point in space.

TIP: Because of the fact that the direction vector must be translated
into pan and tilt angles before sending it to control the light, fades
between directions might not always work the way you expect them to.
This is especially true if the directions you are fading between are
exact opposites of each other: In that case, the angle does not change
at all during the fade until the midpoint, when it reaches the center
of the light, and the light instantly flips around to face the
opposite direction for the rest of the fade. You can also run into
issues where one of the directions you are fading is close to a
geometric singularity (when one of the angles gets near 90&deg;), at
that point the other direction will suddenly dominate, and you can see
unexpected jiggling or changes in direction. For such cases you may be
better off using lower-level <<pan-tilt-effects,pan/tilt effects>>,
which operate closer to the way the lights themselves do.

=== Aim Effects

These are very similar to <<direction-effects,direction effects>>,
except they tell each fixture to aim at a particular point in space,
such as an object or person in front of the lighting rig, or perhaps
another fixture. To create an effect that will tell a fixture or head
what point it should be aiming at, pass the fixture or head to:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.movement/aim-effect name target-point fixtures)
----

The `name` parameter is intended to help identify the purpose of the
effect, and shows up when examining the created effect.

The `target-point` parameter is where you specify the point at which
the lights should be aiming. It is a `javax.vector.Point3d`
identifying a point within the show’s <<show_space#show-space,frame of
reference>>. An easy way to create one is to call
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-aim-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-aim-param].
This can create static points for you, but can also create
<<parameters#dynamic-parameters,Dynamic Parameters>> whose value
depends on a <<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>>, the physical
location or orientation of the head, or a show variable, perhaps
<<mapping_sync#mapping-a-control-to-a-variable,bound>> to a MIDI
control surface. Using a tablet with an OSC or midi interface that
lets you drag an aiming point around a map of the stage is one fun
possibility.

If a group of fixtures is assigned the same direction effect, they
will all face the same direction. If they are assigned the same aim
effect, they will all face slightly different directions in order to
aim at the same point in space.

=== Pan/Tilt Effects

These are essentially the same as <<direction-effects,direction
effects>>, except they use a pan and tilt angle to tell the fixtures
which way to face, so they are closer to the way the lights naturally
work, will be more familiar to light show designers, and can behave
more smoothly and predictably when fading into each other. To create
an effect that will tell a fixture or head what direction it should be
pointing via pan and tilt angles, pass the fixture or head to:

[source,clojure]
----
(afterglow.effects.movement/pan-tilt-effect name pan-tilt fixtures)
----

The `name` parameter is intended to help identify the purpose of the
effect, and shows up when examining the created effect.

The `pan-tilt` parameter is where you specify the angles in which the
lights should be aiming. It is a `javax.vector.Vector2d` whose `x`
component contains the `pan` angle, and whose `y` component contains
the `tilt` angle. These angles tell the fixture how far, in radians,
it should rotate away from pointing straight out at the audience
(along the `z` axis of the show’s <<show_space#show-space,frame of
reference>>). An easy way to create the pan-tilt vector is to call
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-pan-tilt-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-pan-tilt-param].
This function also allows you to work in degrees rather than radians,
if that is more convenient. It can create static angle vectors for
you, but can also create <<parameters#dynamic-parameters,Dynamic
Parameters>> whose value depends on a
<<metronomes#metronomes,Metronome>>, the physical location or
orientation of the head, or a show variable, perhaps
<<mapping_sync#mapping-a-control-to-a-variable,bound>> to a MIDI
control surface.

Because when you fade between pan-tilt effects, the angles always
change smoothly, and correspond to the actual movements of the lights,
they can be easier building blocks for natural-looking movement
effects when you aren't trying to track particular points in space.

If a group of fixtures is assigned the same pan-tilt or direction
effect, they will all face the same direction. If they are assigned
the same aim effect, they will all face slightly different directions
in order to aim at the same point in space.

=== Function Effects

Fixtures have a wide variety of different capabilities, often more
than would be reasonable to assign a separate DMX channel for each,
especially when it does not make sense to activate or control some at
the same time. Afterglow can be told about these in the
<<fixture_definitions#fixture-definitions,fixture definition>>, and
you can control them using function effects, by specifying the name of
the function you want to activate, and a _percentage_ (a value between
`0` and `100`) by which you want it activated. (The percentage will be
translated to the corresponding value within that function’s valid DMX
range that Afterglow should send).

For example, many fixtures have a strobe function, which causes them to
flash off and on at a particular speed. The following line shows how to
cause them all to strobe at their fastest speed:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :strobe (afterglow.effects.channel/function-effect
  "Fastest strobe" :strobe 100 (show/all-fixtures)))
----

With this effect active, any fixture with a `:strobe` function range
will be sent the highest value defined for that range, on the channel on
which the function exists, causing it to strobe rapidly. Fixtures which
lack such a function will be unaffected.

Function effects can be very specific to individual fixtures. For
example, the Blizzard Torrent F3 has a pair of gobo wheels; one of them
has a gobo that projects something that looks like a fat atom with
electrons orbiting it. This projection can be selected, and caused to
jiggle back and forth at the mid-range of possible shake speeds, by
adding the following effect:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :gobo-fixed
  (afterglow.effects.channel/function-effect "Brownian motion?"
    :gobo-fixed-atom-shake 50 (show/fixtures-named "torrent")))
----

Depending on how far away the projection is landing, it may be very
blurry; focus can be adjusted like so:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :focus
  (afterglow.effects.channel/function-effect
    "focus" :focus 95.5 (show/fixtures-named "torrent")))
----

The functions available for a fixture, their names, channels, and
ranges, are specified by the
<<fixture_definitions#fixture-definitions,fixture definition>>, so
reading over those can be helpful. (And carefully crafting and testing
them is important when defining a new fixture.) Trying to maintain
consistency in function naming is valuable in allowing functions to be
conveniently applied to groups of different fixtures.

Functions which do not vary in their effect for different DMX values
within the legal range are described as `:range :fixed` in the fixture
definition; this is currently only used for displaying the
interpretation of a fixture setting, you still need to provide a
percentage within the range when setting up the function effect.

Fixture definitions can also supply a _scaling function_ for a function
specification, which maps input values to the final percentage within
the DMX range. This is helpful, for example, to allow strobe settings to
be interpreted as approximate Hz values, so fixtures from different
manufacturers can be asked to strobe at roughly the same rate for the
same function setting. You can view the source of the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.fixtures.blizzard.html[Blizzard
fixture definitions] for examples of how this is done, passing the
minimum and maximum Hz strobe rates of the actual fixture to create a
partial implementation of
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.channel.html#var-function-value-scaler[afterglow.effects.channel/function-value-scaler]
which is passed the value that the effect is trying to establish, and
converts it to a position in that fixture’s range which attempts to
approximate that strobing rate.

=== Channel Effects

When you just want to send a specific number to a particular DMX
channel, you can drop right down to the bottom level with channel
effects. For example, to pin the dimmer channel of a group of fixtures
to 55, regardless of the setting of the show’s master chain, you could
do something like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :blade-dimmers
  (afterglow.effects.channel/channel-effect "Blade dimmers" 55
    (afterglow.channels/extract-channels
      (show/fixtures-named :blade) #(= (:type %) :dimmer))))
----

Or to look at what actual pan values do to a Torrent, without fancy
geometric transformations, as you set values into the show variable
named `:pan`:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :pan-torrent
  (afterglow.effects.channel/channel-effect
    "Pan Torrent" (params/build-variable-param :pan)
    (afterglow.channels/extract-channels
      (show/fixtures-named :torrent) #(= (:type %) :pan))))
----

You will most likely be wanting to do this sort of thing for channel
types which Afterglow does not yet have a more sophisticated
understanding, and then perhaps you will end up creating a whole new
category of effects as your experimentation progresses.

=== Compound Effects

The most straightforward way to create interesting shows is to combine
multiple simple effects in different ways. Compound effects are tools
which enable that.

==== Scenes

The simplest way to build a compound effect is to combine a group of
effects into one which can be started and stopped as a unit. That is
the purpose of the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.html#var-scene[scene]
function in the `afterglow.effects` namespace. It takes a name for the
scene to be created, followed by one or more effects to be grouped,
and returns an effect which combines them all under that name:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color
  (afterglow.effects/scene "Blue Sparks"
    (afterglow.examples/global-color-effect :blue)
    (fun/sparkle (show/all-fixtures) :chance 0.07 :fade-time 500)))
----

Assuming you are running the sample show and have the dimmers up,
you'll see all the lights turn blue, and a random pattern of white
<<effects#sparkle,sparkles>> twinkling across them. Ending the scene
effect will end both underlying effects in a coordinated fashion (the
blue color effect will linger as the last sparkles fade out).

==== Blank Effects

A blank effect does nothing at all. Although this might not
immediately seem useful, assigning a blank effect to one side or the
other of a <<effects#fades,fade>> (below) lets you fade an effect in
or out, from or to nothing. In such cases the fade also takes care
that as it fades towards the blank effect, whatever effects were being
replaced by the fade are restored.

To create a blank effect, simply call the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.html#var-blank[blank]
function in the `afterglow.effects` namespace.

==== Fades

A fade effect lets you smoothly transition from one effect to another,
blending a weighted combination of each. The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.html#var-fade[fade]
function in the `afterglow.effects` namespace supports this. It takes
a name for the fade to be created, followed by `from-effect` and
`to-effect`, the two effects to be faded between, and a `phase`
parameter which controls how much of each effect is seen. It returns
the blended effect.

When the value of `phase` is `0` (or less), the fade acts as if it is
simply `from-effect`. When `phase` is `1` (or more), the fade behaves
identical to `to-effect`. When `phase` falls somewhere between `0` and
`1`, a corresponding linear blend between `from-effect` and
`to-effect` is created. At the value `0.5`, each effect contributes
the same amount.

Either or both of the effects being faded between can be a
<<effects#scenes,scene>>, which groups many other effects, or one can
be a <<effects#blank-effects,blank effect>>, which will simply fade
the other effect in or out of existence (allowing any earlier or
lower-priority effects to show through). When fading between two
non-blank effects, if they include different groups of fixtures (or
affect different aspects of the fixtures they do include), the same
notion of &ldquo;seeing what is underneath&rdquo; the fade applies, as
the side which is controlling a particular fixture or feature is faded
out.

The `phase` parameter can (and usually will) be a dynamic parameter,
probably a <<parameters#variable-parameters,variable parameter>> or
<<parameters#oscillated-parameters,oscillated parameter>>, so the fade
will take place over time, or under the control of an operator using a
control surface.

Here is an example of a very simple fade cue from the sample show:

[source,clojure]
----
(ct/set-cue! (:cue-grid *show*) 4 7
             (cues/cue :color-fade
                       (fn [var-map]
                           (fx/fade "Color Fade"
                                    (global-color-effect :red :include-color-wheels? true)
                                    (global-color-effect :green :include-color-wheels? true)
                                    (params/bind-keyword-param (:phase var-map 0) Number 0)))
                       :variables [{:key "phase" :min 0.0 :max 1.0 :start 0.0 :name "Fade"}]))
----

This fades all the lights from red to green as the cue's encoder is
turned. Switching either color effect to `(blank)` would insted fade
to or from whatever color the fixtures were otherwise displaying at
the time.

==== Chases

Chase effects allow you to sequence a series of effects one after
another, with optional <<effects#fades,fades>> between them. They are
built using the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.html#var-chase[chase]
function in the `afterglow.effects` namespace. Of course each effect
within the chase can itself be a <<effects#scenes,scene>>, which
groups many other effects, or a <<effects#blank-effects,blank
effect>>, which will simply fade the chase temporarily out of
existence (allowing any earlier or lower-priority effects to show
through). When fading between two non-blank effects, if they include
different groups of fixtures (or affect different aspects of the
fixtures they do include), the same notion of &ldquo;seeing what is
underneath&rdquo; the fade applies, as the side which is controlling a
particular fixture or feature is faded out.

In addition to the list of effects which make up the chase, a
`position` parameter is used to create it. When the effect is
rendered, the current value of this parameter is an index into the
effects that make up the chase, and it controls which one is currently
visible. When `position` is `1`, the first effect in `effects` is
active; `2` causes the second to be seen, and so on. Non-integer
values are how fades are accomplished, they result in a linear blend
between the corresponding effects. In order to make the chase evolve
over time, `position` needs to be a dynamic variable parameter, and
https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/parameters.adoc#step-parameters[Step
Parameters], created by the function
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.params.html#var-build-step-param[afterglow.effects.params/build-step-param],
are designed specifically to work with chases.

With no other arguments, the chase will end when `position` has a
value less than zero, or greater than the number of elements in
`effects` plus one. Values between `0` and `1` fade into the first
effect from nothing, and as the value grows above the number of
entries in `effects`, it begins to fade out the final effect.

A chase can be made open-ended by supplying a value with the optional
keyword argument `:beyond`. The default value, `:blank`, causes the
behavior described in the previous paragraph. If `:beyond` is supplied
with the value `:loop`, the chase will act as if the `effects` list
contained an infinite number of copies of itself. So when `position`
grows past the final index, the last effect in the list fades back
into the first entry. Similarly, values of `position` below `1` fade
back to the end of the list. In this configuration, the chase will
only end when either all of the underlying effects contained within
the `effects` list have ended on their own, or `position` resolves to
`nil`, which always ends a chase immediately.

Another way to create an open-ended chase is to pass `:beyond` with
the value `:bounce`. This acts like `:loop`, except that whenever one
end of the list of `effects` is reached, the chase changes direction
and moves back through the list from that point. In other words, if
`position` keeps growing steadily in value, and there are three
effects in `effects`, with a `:beyond` value of `:loop` you will see
them in the order 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3
&rarr; 1&hellip; while a value of `:bounce` would give you 1 &rarr; 2
&rarr; 3 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 2&hellip;.

==== Conditional Effects

The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.html#var-conditional-effect[conditional-effect]
function in the `afterglow.effects` namespace wraps another effect,
allowing it to run only when the value of some dynamic parameter (most
likely a <<parameters#variable-parameters,variable parameter>> or
<<parameters#oscillated-parameters,oscillated parameter>>) is not
zero.
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.shows.sallie.html#var-global-color-effect[afterglow.shows.sallie/global-color-effect]
shows an example of using it within a scene to optionally have the
color effect apply to a laser show running simultaneously with the
light show, controlled by the show variable `:also-color-laser`. This
variable gets set when the &ldquo;Also color laser&rdquo; cue is
running, by means of a Variable Effect, described in the next section.

==== Variable Effects

The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.show-variable.html#var-create-for-show[variable-effect]
function in the `afterglow.effects.show-variable` namespace creates an
effect which does not set any DMX values. Instead, it makes use of the
rendering loop <<rendering_loop#extensions,extension mechanism>> to
set a show variable while the effect is active. This dovetails very
nicely with Conditional Effects, described above.

You can see an example of how to use variable effects in
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.shows.sallie.html#var-use-sallie-show[afterglow.shows.sallie/use-sallie-show],
which creates a binding to the show variables using
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.show-variable.html#var-create-for-show[afterglow.effects.show-variable/create-for-show].
Then
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.shows.sallie.html#var-make-cues[afterglow.shows.sallie/make-cues]
uses that `var-binder` to create a `:color-laser` cue which sets the
show variable `:also-color-laser` while it runs:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns afterglow.shows.sallie
;; ...
  (:require [afterglow.effects.show-variable :as var-fx]
;; ...
)
;; ...
(reset! var-binder (var-fx/create-for-show *show*))
;; ...
(ct/set-cue! (:cue-grid *show*) 5 7
               (cues/cue :color-laser
                         (fn [_] (var-fx/variable-effect @var-binder :also-color-laser 1))
                         :color :red :short-name "Also color laser"))
----

This variable setting causes the Conditional Effects in scenes created
by `global-color-effect` (as described in the preceding section) to
also send commands to the laser show.

=== Complex Effects

These are effects which build on more than one of the capabilities
listed above to create an interesting or fun effect. They represent
examples of how Afterglow can be used to create new things, and we
hope that people will contribute their own effects for inclusion in
future releases.

==== Color Cycle Chases

This family of related effects are an excellent illustration of why
Afterglow was created, which was to enable the concise expression and
implementation of effects like them. They leverage many of the
building blocks within Afterglow, and provide a framework to combine
them in flexible ways using functional composition to acheive a
variety of different looks that change in space at appropriate musical
times, with very little code required in each. They are useful in
themselves, and as examples of how to write similar effects.

The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.fun.html#var-iris-out-color-cycle-chase[Iris
Out] color cycle chase changes the color of a group of fixtures to a
different color for each bar of a phrase of music. During the down
beat of each new bar, the color spreads over the participating
fixtures starting at their geometric center in the x-y plane of
https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/show_space.adoc#show-space[show
space], and spreading in an expanding circle until reaching the
furthest heads at the end of the down beat.

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color
  (afterglow.effects.fun/iris-out-color-cycle-chase (show/all-fixtures)))
----

If you look at the source code (which you can always get to by
following the &ldquo;view source&rdquo; link at the bottom of the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.fun.html#var-iris-out-color-cycle-chase[API
documentation], or typing `(source
afterglow.effects.fun/iris-out-color-cycle-chase)` in a REPL or the
web console), you will see that it is only a few lines, once you get
past the documentation and parameters, most of which are given default
values to pass along to
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.fun.html#var-color-cycle-chase[color-cycle-chase],
which is used to actually implement the chase.

Those parameters can be used to change the set of colors in the cycle,
as well as control when the color changes, and when and how quickly
the transition occurs. The documentation for `color-cycle-chase`
explains how.

The body of `iris-out-color-cycle-chase` simply sets up the measure
function which causes the iris-out effect to behave as described,
measuring a circular distance in the x-y plane (ignoring the z axis)
from the center of the fixtures that have been assigned to participate
in the effect. This is why it is easy to set up a family of similar
effects which create different spatial transitions for the color cycle
chase.

For example,
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.fun.html#var-wipe-right-color-cycle-chase[Wipe
Right], which transitions the lights from left to right, ignoring both
the y and z axes. The work of both of these chases is simplified with
the help of
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.transform.html#var-build-distance-measure[afterglow.transform/build-distance-measure],
a function for constructing distance measure functions for use in
effects like this, and
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.transform.html#var-calculate-bounds[afterglow.transform/calculate-bounds],
which calculates a bounding box and center for a group of fixtures and
the heads which make them up.

[source,clojure]
----

==== Sparkle

supplied fixture heads. See the

==== Strobe

A flexible strobe effect designed for intuitive tweaking via pressure-sensitive controllers like the Ableton Push.

----

  (afterglow.effects.fun/strobe "Strobe All" (show/all-fixtures) 50))
----

==== Metronome

The Metronome cue is a way to check the synchronization of the show
metronome with your DJ software or mixer if you don't have an Ableton
Push or an easy way to pull up the web interface, and is mostly a nice
example of how to write a cue that is driven by a metronome. It was
one of the first clearly metronome-driven effects written, and was
extremely useful when developing the metronome sync facilities
(especially since at the time there was no web or Ableton Push
interface, with their metronome monitoring and adjustment sections).
Today it is less interesting, especially compared to the color cycle
chases described above.

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color
  (afterglow.effects.fun/metronome-effect (show/all-fixtures)))
----

Creates an effect which flashes the heads of the supplied fixtures one
color on the down beat and another color on the other beats of the
show metronome. The default down beat color is a lightened red, and
the other beat color is a darkened yellow; these can be overridden by
optional keyword parameters. See the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.fun.html#var-metronome-effect[API
documentation] for details.

== The Effect Lifecycle

When an effect is added to a show via `(show/add-effect! :effect-key
effect)` it immediately replaces any other effect which had been
previously added with the same keyword. The former effect does not get
a chance to gracefully finish its effects, it is simply gone. The new
effect is added to the <<rendering_loop#the-rendering-loop,rendering
loop>> in a position determined by the priority value, if any,
specified after the optional `:priority` keyword argument. If no
priority argument is supplied, a priority of zero is used. The new
effect is added after any other existing effects of the same (or
lower) priority, but before any existing effects with higher priority.
Since later effects get a chance to override earlier effects, this
means that higher-priority effects, and effects added later, win.

All effects implement the
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.html#var-IEffect[afterglow.effects/IEffect]
protocol. As each frame of lighting control values is rendered, a
snapshot is created from the show metronome, so every effect shares the
same notion of the point in time at which effects are being rendered.
The priority-ordered list of effects is traversed, and each effect’s
`(still-active? [this show snapshot])` function is invoked to determine
if the effect has ended at this point. If this returns `true`, the
effect is removed from the list of active effects, and is finished.
Limited-time effects can use this mechanism to tell the show when they
finish. Ongoing effects will simply always return `true`, or if they
want to end gracefully, will return `true` until they have been asked to
end, and their graceful ending has completed.

Assuming the effect has not reported completion, its `(generate [this
show snapshot])` function will be called, as described in the
<<rendering_loop#the-rendering-loop,rendering loop>> section, to
create the effect it represents at this point in time.

At some point, the show operator may indicate a desire for the effect
to end, by calling `(show/end-effect! :effect-key force)`. If `force`
is `true`, the specified effect will simply be removed from the list
of active effects. If `force` is omitted or `false`, the effect is
asked to end gracefully by calling its `(end [this show snapshot])`
function. If the effect is ready to end right away, it can return
`true`, and will be removed at that point. Otherwise, if it wants to
take a little while to animate an ending effect, it should set an
internal flag so it knows it is ending and return `false`, and at some
point in the not-so-distant future, conclude its ending and return
`false` from `still-active?`.

WARNING: As implied by the preceding paragraph, your effect cannot rely
on its `end` function ever being called. If the effect is ended
forcibly, if another effect is added under the same keyword, or if it
is taking part in a fade, at some point it will simply be discarded.
It must therefore not retain any resources that will not be reclaimed
by simple garbage collection.

If `end-effect!` is called a second time for an effect which was already
asked to end, even if `force` is false, it will be removed forcibly at
that point.

== Effect Examples

Here are a few ways in which effects can be used and combined.

NOTE: These examples assume you are in a Clojure REPL with Afterglow loaded,
in the namespace `afterglow.examples`. This is the default namespace you
get if you check out the project and run `lein repl`.


=== Oscillator Effects

Oscillators in Afterglow are a flexible way of turning the timing
information tracked by metronomes into waveforms that can be used to
make lights do interesting things. They can be related to the beats or
bars of the metronome, or multiples or fractions thereof, and can be
sawtooth, triangle, square, or sine waves.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave[Wikipedia] has a nice
introduction to these waveforms. The namespace
`afterglow.effects.oscillator` has
<<oscillators#oscillators,functions>> for creating lots of variations
on them.

Here is one way to create a basic oscillated hue effect which cycles
through all colors over one bar of the show metronome:

[source,clojure]
----
(def hue-param (oscillators/build-oscillated-param
                 (oscillators/sawtooth :interval :bar) :max 360))
(show/add-effect! :color (global-color-effect
   (params/build-color-param :s 100 :l 50 :h hue-param)))
----

TIP: Remember that if you aren’t seeing anything when after assigning color
effects to a fixture to make sure you also have a dimmer effect setting
that fixture’s dimmer to some visible level.

We can set up separate metronomes as show variables, so that effect
timing can be separate from the main show, which is intended to track
the beat of the music. Here we will create a metronome running at 5
beats per minute in a show variable we will call `timer`.

[source,clojure]
----
    (show/set-variable! :timer (metronome 50))
----

Then we can build an oscillated hue parameter based on that timer, for a
nice, gradual color fade. We will use a sawtooth wave since it smoothly
goes from its minimum to its maximum value. Zero is the default minimum,
which is perfect, since it is the lowest hue value. We will tell the
oscillated parameter to range from that to a maximum of 360, the largest
hue. Since hues form a circle, we will fade smoothly around the circle
for each oscillation, with no jarring transition from one bar to the
next:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/set-variable! :hue-param
  (oscillators/build-oscillated-param (oscillators/sawtooth :interval :bar)
    :metronome :timer :max 360))
----

Notice the use of the keyword `:timer` to tell `build-oscillated-param`
to use the show variable with that name for its `:metronome` keyword
parameter. We can do the same thing when building our color effect to
use this oscillated hue parameter variable:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color (global-color-effect
  (params/build-color-param :s 100 :l 50 :h :hue-param)))
----

We can change the speed of the fade by changing the BPM of the
metronome stored in the show variable:

[source,clojure]
----
(metro-bpm (show/get-variable :timer) 500)
----

Suddenly it is crazy fast!

[source,clojure]
----
(metro-bpm (show/get-variable :timer) 5)
----

Back to a sedate fade.

=== Spatial Effects

Rather than spreading the rainbow out in time, how about if we spread it
physically across the lights in the show, in the form of a rainbow
gradient along the X axis?

[source,clojure]
----
(def hue-gradient (params/build-spatial-param (show/all-fixtures)
  (fn [head] (- (:x head) (:min-x @(:dimensions *show*)))) :end 360))
(show/add-effect! :color (global-color-effect
  (params/build-color-param :s 100 :l 50 :h hue-gradient)
                            :include-color-wheels true))
----

NOTE: Since this cue is not constantly changing over time, it makes
sense to allow fixtures that use color wheels to participate.

That’s pretty! But now that we have both of these interesting concepts,
oscillators and spatial gradients, wouldn’t it be nice if we could
combine them? Oh, but we can!

[source,clojure]
----
(def adjust-param
  (oscillators/build-oscillated-param (oscillators/sawtooth :interval :bar) :max 360))
(show/add-effect! :color (global-color-effect
  (params/build-color-param :s 100 :l 50 :h hue-gradient
                            :adjust-hue adjust-param)))
----

NOTE: Now the rainbow drifts across the whole lighting rig. We left out color
wheels this time, since the color is continually shifting.

The <<effect-types,Effect Types>> section goes into more
detail about how these effects work.

TIP: Looking at the source code of the <<complex-effects,complex
effects>> is a great way to learn about how to create effects, and to
get ideas for ways to vary or build on them.

=== Layering Effects

Rather than building separate effects for every combination of ideas,
you can get much more power by building effects that build on or
modify each other, which you can then compose in different ways. The
most straightforward way of doing this is by combining effects that
work on different facets of the lights, such as when you choose a
dimmer oscillator, to make them pulse in a particular way with the
beat, along with a color effect, and perhaps an aim or direction
chase. Varying these effects can give you quite a palette of looks.

The Afterglow <<rendering_loop#the-rendering-loop,rendering loop>> is
designed to let you be even more flexible than that, though: you can
combine multiple effects which work on the same channels of the same
fixtures, because of the way that later (and higher priority) effects
can see what earlier effects have done, and modify the results.

The
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.color.html#var-transform-colors[transform-colors]
effect is an example of how easy and flexible this can be. (As always
with the API documentation, you can click on the `viw source` button
to see the actual implementation of the function.) This effect uses
its own variable parameter to adjust the saturation of any color being
sent to the fixtures it is assigned. (If there isn't currently a color
being assigned to those fixtures, it does nothing.) Calling it with no
arguments uses a default transformation and oscillated parameter which
causes the saturation of the color to start each beat fully saturated,
and to fade to gray by the end of the beat. This was inspired by the
rainbow fade effect which was initially created while experimenting
with
https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow-max#afterglow-max[afterglow-max],
but this generalization can be combined with any other color effect.

The `transform-colors` function itself does all the work of creating
assigners that will watch for colors being sent to the fixtures it is
supposed to affect, and whenever appropriate, transforming them. The
transformation itself is separated into another function, which can be
passed in as an argument to achieve a totally different kind of
transformation. The default transformation if none is specified is
created by calling
http://deepsymmetry.org/afterglow/doc/afterglow.effects.color.html#var-build-saturation-transformation[build-saturation-transformation]
with no arguments. The source of this function shows how easy it is to
write a transformation given the support provided by the Rendering
Loop and `transform-colors`.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn build-saturation-transformation
  "Creates a color transformation for use with [[transform-colors]]
  which changes the saturation based on a variable parameter. If no
  parameter is supplied, the default is to use an oscillated parameter
  based on [[sawtooth]] with `:down?` set to `true` so the color
  is fully saturated at the start of the beat, and fully desaturated
  by the end. A different pattern can be created by supplying a
  different parameter with the `:param` optional keyword argument."
  {:doc/format :markdown}
  [& {:keys [param] :or {param (oscillators/build-oscillated-param (osc/sawtooth :down? true)
                                                                   :max 100)}}]
  (fn [color show snapshot head]
    (let [saturation (colors/clamp-percent-float
                      (params/resolve-param param show snapshot head))]
      (colors/create-color {:h (colors/hue color) :s saturation :l (colors/lightness color)}))))
----

This particular function takes an optional variable
parameter to control what the current saturation should be (if you
don't provide one, it creates an
<<parameters#oscillated-parameters,oscillated parameter>> which
implements the desaturate-over-each-beat behavior described above:

[source,clojure]
----
(oscillators/build-oscillated-param (oscillators/sawtooth :down? true) :max 100)
----

The downwards-direction sawtooth wave from 100 to 0 each beat causes
the saturation pattern described; changing to a different wave form,
or something which oscillates over a bar or phrase or fraction
thereof, or with different `:min` and `:max` values would achieve a
different effect.

The function returned by `build-saturation-transformation` is called
by `transform-colors` when Afterglow is calculating a frame of DMX
data to send to the lights, whenver one of the lights that the
`transform-colors` effect has been applied to is being sent a color
value. The function is called with the color that has so far been
assigned to the light (in `color`), and the current `show`, metronome
`snapshot` representing the current instant in musical time (and which
can be used with an oscillated variable parameter as seen here to
generate smoothly changing, rhythmically-driven values), and the light
`head` this is being sent to (which can be used to perform
<<effects.adoc#spatial-effects,spatial>> calculations as described
above). The function returns a new color to replace the former
assignment (or it could return `nil` to suppress coloring the light
entirely).

Having all this information at hand, and the flexible power of
<<oscillators#oscillators,oscillators>> and
<<parameters#dynamic-parameters,dynamic>>,
<<parameters#oscillated-parameters,oscillated>>, and
<<parameters#spatial-parameters,spatial>> variable parameters, makes
it possible to write straightforward, concise transformation functions
like this one.

And of course you can change things other than
saturation; take a look at the source and try writing your own
transformation functions which do different things. When you come up
with exciting looks, please contribute them back to Afterglow!

Remember that when you create a cue for an effect like
`transform-color`, you want it to run _after_ the other effects that
it is going to transform, so give it a high effect priority. Here is
how the sample show configures it:

[source,clojure]
----
(ct/set-cue! (:cue-grid *show*) 2 7
             (cues/cue :transform-colors (fn [_] (color-fx/transform-colors
                                                  (show/all-fixtures)))
                       :priority 1000))
----

And here is a complete, concrete example of how you can try out
`transform-colors` from the REPL:

[source,clojure]
----
(show/add-effect! :color
  (afterglow.effects/scene "Blue Sparks"
    (global-color-effect :blue)
    (color-fx/transform-colors (show/all-fixtures) :priority 1000)))
----

> This assigns a blue color to all the lights, and pulses them to
white once per beat.
