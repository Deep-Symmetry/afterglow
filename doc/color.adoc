Cues that assign color to lights are designed to leverage the
https://github.com/jolby/colors[jolby/colors] library. In addition to
creating colors by name, as in the Usage examples, you can create them
by hex string, RGB values, and, most usefully when thinking about how to
mix and fade them, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV[HSL] (Hue,
Saturation, and Lightness). So, if you wanted a cue that shifts back and
forth around yellow, and don't remember the hue value of yellow, you
could do something like this:

[source,clojure]
----
(use 'com.evocomputing.colors)
(def yellow (create-color "yellow"))
(def hue-param (params/build-oscillated-param
  (oscillators/sine-beat) :min (hue (adjust-hue yellow -5))
                          :max (hue (adjust-hue yellow 5))))
(show/add-effect! :color (global-color-effect
  (params/build-color-param :s 100 :l 50 :h hue-param)))
----

You can add lighten it up by changing to something like `:l 70` in the
`build-color-param` call, darken it a bunch with `:l 20` or desaturate
it a touch with `:s 80`... For more options and ideas, delve into the
colors library http://jolby.github.io/colors/[API documentation],
and the various <<oscillators#oscillators,oscillators>> that Afterglow
makes available to you.

Since working with colors is so fundamental to creating light shows,
the mechanism for creating <<parameters#color-parameters,dynamic color
parameters>> is very well developed, and worth getting familiar with.
You can often avoid having to write your own function entirely by
clever combinations of oscillated parameters for creating dynamic
color parameters.

### Modifying Colors

You can also create a variety of layered looks by building effects
that work with each other, rather than having to create a separate
effect for each combination. The discussion on
<<effects#layering-effects,layering effects>> explains how to do this
and points at a sample implementation that ships with Afterglow.
