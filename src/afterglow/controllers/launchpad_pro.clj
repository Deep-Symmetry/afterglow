  Establish a connection to the Novation Launchpad Pro, for managing

  Initializes the display and starts the UI updater thread. Since
  SysEx messages are required for updating the display, if you are on
  a Mac, Afterglow
  embeds [CoreMIDI4J](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J) to
  provide a working implementation.

  If you have more than one Launchpad connected, or have renamed how
  it appears in your list of MIDI devices, you need to supply a value
  after `:device-filter` which identifies the ports to be used to
  communicate with the Launchpad you want this function to use. The
  values returned by [[afterglow.midi/open-inputs-if-needed!]]
  and [[afterglow.midi/open-outputs-if-needed!]] will be searched, and
  the first port that matches with [[filter-devices]] will be used.

  The controller will be identified in the user interface (for the
  purposes of linking it to the web cue grid) as \"Launchpad Pro\". If
  you would like to use a different name (for example, if have more
  than one Launchpad), you can pass in a custom value after
  `:display-name`.

  If you want the user interface to be refreshed at a different rate
  than the default of fifteen times per second, pass your desired
  number of milliseconds after `:refresh-interval`.

  If you would like to skip the startup animation (for example because
  the device has just powered on and run its own animation), pass

  Watches for a Novation Launchpad Pro controller to be connected,

  it will be re-bound once it reappears. Returns a watcher structure
  which can be passed to [[deactivate]] if you would like to
  stop it watching for reconnections. The underlying controller
  mapping, once bound, can be accessed through the watcher's
