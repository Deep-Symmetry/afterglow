  [mmj](http://www.humatic.de/htools/mmj.htm) to provide a
  working implementation.

  If you have more than one Ableton Push connected, or have renamed
  how it appears in your list of MIDI devices, you need to supply a
  value after `:device-name` which identifies the ports to be used to
  communicate with the Push you want this function to use. The values
  returned by [[afterglow.midi/open-inputs-if-needed!]]
  and [[afterglow.midi/open-outputs-if-needed!]] will be searched, and
  the first port whose name or description contains the supplied
  string will be used.

  The controller will be identified in the user interface (for the
  purposes of linking it to the web cue grid) as \"Ableton Push\". If
  you would like to use a different name (for example, if you are
  lucky enough to have more than one Push), you can pass in a custom
  value after `:display-name`.
