(ns afterglow.show
  "Encapsulates a synchronized light show, executing a varying
  collection of effects with output to a number of DMX universes.
  Assumes control of the assigned universes, so only one show at a
  time should be assigned a given universe. Of course, you can stack
  as many effects as you'd like in that show.

  The effects are maintained in a priority queue, with higher-priority
  effects running after lower-priority ones, so they can adjust or
  simply replace the channel assignments established by earlier
  effects. Some may choose to implement traditional channel-oriented
  highest-takes-prority or latest-takes-priority semantics, others do
  more sophisticated color blending or position averageing. The
  default priority when adding an effect is zero, but you can assign
  it any integer, and it will be inserted into the queue after any
  existing effects with the same priority.

  All effects are assigned a keyword when they are added, and adding a
  new effect with the same key as an existing effect will replace the
  former one."

  modifier to indicate it should be ended when the button is released.

(defn patch-fixture!
  "Patch a fixture to a universe in [[*show*]] at a starting DMX
  channel address, at a particular point in space, with a particular
  orientation.

  `key` is a keyword identifying the fixture. If you need to remove
  the fixture later, or re-patch it with different parameters, you can
  do that by passing the same keyword to [[remove-fixture!]] or
  `patch-fixture!`. If you have a set of fixtures that you want to be
  able to easily group, give them keywords that start with the same
  name, followed by a hyphen and uniqe numbers. That way, if you pass
  the name portion (everthing before the final hyphen and number)
  to [[fixtures-named]], you will get back a list of all those
  fixtures.

  `fixture` is a [Fixture Definition
  map](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/fixture_definitions.adoc#fixture-definitions)
  which specifies all the capabilities of the fixture and how
  Afterglow can control it.

  `universe` identifies which DMX universe the fixture is attached to,
  and must be one of the universe numbers that was passed in the
  `universes` argument to [[show]] when creating the show.
  `start-address` identifies the DMX address of the first channel the
  fixture is listening to in that universe (it will be displayed on
  the fixture's configuration panel or DIP switches), and is an
  integer ranging from `1` to `512`, the legal DMX addresses in a
  universe. The attempt to patch will fail if there are more channels
  in the fixture definition than fit within the 512-channel address
  space starting at that address, or if any of the addresses used by
  the fixture have already been assigned to other patched fixtures.

  Coordinates and rotations are optional, expressed along with the
  keyword arguments `:x`, `:y`, `:z`, `:x-rotation`, `:y-rotation`,
  and `:z-rotation`, which all default to zero if not specified. All
  coordinates and rotations are interpreted with respect to the [show
  frame of
  reference](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/show_space.adoc#show-space),
  and are in meters and radians. You can
  use [[transform/inches]], [[transform/feet]]
  and [[transform/degrees]] to convert those units for you if
  desired."
