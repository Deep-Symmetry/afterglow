(defn patch-lighting-rig
  "An example of how to patch a whole group of lights with a
  parameterized location. We mount our lights on our lighting rig in
  standard positions, so knowing the position of the rig and the
  height to which it has been adjusted allows us to figure out where
  all the lights are on it.

  For the moment the orientation of the rig defines the orientation of
  the show, and the origins of the show axes are the spot on the floor
  underneath the center of the horizontal truss. The _z_ axis
  increases towards the audience from that point.

  Because the height of the rig can be adjusted, you can pass in a
  value with `:y` to set the height of the center of the lower bar on
  the horizontal truss. If omitted a default height of 62.5 inches is
  used, which is approximately the height of the bar when the
  extension poles are collapsed for load-in and strike.

  We try to hang blades 1-4 at an angle of 72.5 degrees leaning towards
  the audience, and blade 5 sags to about 101 degrees but if any angle
  ends up being off and difficult to correct, it can be passed in with
  `:blade-1-angle` through `:blade-5-angle` The actual mounting height
  of blade 5, if it differs from 4 inches can be passed with
  `:blade-5-height`.

  Fixture numbers are assigned stage left to stage right (looking at
  the lights from behind the rig), except for blade 5, which is an
  extra which is sometimes placed in the middle.

  It would be possible to extend this function to support positioning
  and rotating the truss within show space, now that `patch-fixture`
  allows you to pass in a transformation matrix. But until that
  complexity is needed, this simpler approach seems practical. The
  truss is the main component of our show, so having it be at the
  origin makes sense."
