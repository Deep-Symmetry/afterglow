(defn apply-channel-value
  "A function which sets the DMX buffer value(s) for a channel, supporting fine channels
  as well (in which there is a high and low byte), using any fractional part of the value
  to determine the fine channel value if one is present.

  Also supports inverted channels (as needed for some fixtures which
  have inverted dimmers). Such channels are specified by containing an
  `:inverted-from` key which specifies the DMX value at which
  inversion occurs. If the entire DMX range is inverted, in other
  words 0 represents the highest value and 255 the lowest,
  `:inverted-from` will be present with the value `0`. For dimmers
  which are still black at zero, but which leap to full brightness at
  1 then dim as the value grows towards 255, `:inverted-from` will be
  present with the value `1`. Non-inverted channels will lack the key
  entirely."
