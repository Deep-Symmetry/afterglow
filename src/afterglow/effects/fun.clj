(defn strobe
  "A compound effect which sets dimmers to the level determined by the
  show variable `:strobe-dimmers` (defaulting to 255), assigns a color
  based on the show variables `:strobe-hue` (with a default of 277,
  purple) `:strobe-saturation` (with a default of 100), and and the
  specified `lightness` (which may be a dynamic parameter), with a
  default of 100, which would white out the hue until it was lowered.
  The effect then sets the fixtures' strobe channel to the specified
  `level`, which may also be a dynamic parameter.

  This is designed to be run as a high priority queue, ideally while
  held and with aftertouch adjusting a cue-introduced variable for
  `level` (which is used to control the strobe function of the
  affected fixtures, setting the strobe speed, and defaults to a
  middle value). The global strobe color can be adjusted via the show
  variables, either by aftertouch or by another effect with no assigners,
  like [[adjust-strobe]]."

(defn color-cycle-chase
  "Returns an effect which moves through a color cycle over a period
  of time (by default changing each bar of a phrase), performing a
  transition as a new color is introduced, using the specified
  distance measure to determine when each light starts to participate.
  By default the transition occurs over the down beat (first beat)
  of the bar. See below for how these defaults can be changed.
  
  The distance measure supplied as the second argument is a function
  which accepts a fixture or head and returns a nonnegative value
  which controls the point during the transition when that head will
  change from the old color to the new color. A fixture returning a
  value of 0 will change as soon as transition has started, and the
  fixture(s) that return the largest value will change when the
  transition ends. A value halfway between zero and the largest value
  would mean the color of that fixture or head would change exactly at
  the midpoint of the transition. Many interesting looking
  transtitions can be created using distance measures constructed by
  calling [[afterglow.transform/build-distance-measure]], as is done
  by [[iris-out-color-cycle-chase]] and several examples which follow
  it. There are lots of other kinds of functions which can created,
  though; at the opposite extreme you can do completely arbitrary
  things like assigning each head a random \"distance\" when the
  effect is created.

  The sequence of colors which are cycled through can be changed by
  passing in a vector with `:color-cycle`. Each value in the vector
  can either be a color object, or a dynamic parameter which resolves
  to a color object when the effect is running. As ususal, you can
  bind to show variables containing a color by passing the variable
  names as keywords within the vector.

  When the effect is being rendered, the current color index within
  `:color-cycle` is determined by calling a function with the snapshot
  obtained from the show metronome at the start of the rendering
  frame. The default
  function, [[afterglow.rhythm/snapshot-bar-within-phrase]], will
  assign a different color for each bar of a phrase. (If there are not
  enough colors in `:color-cycle` the cycle is repeated as necessary.)
  You can pass another index function with `:color-index-function` to
  change how and when the cycle is traversed.

  The function supplied with `:transition-phase-function` determines
  precisely when the transition takes place and how quickly it occurs.
  It is also called with the show metronome snapshot, and if the value
  it returns is less than zero, the transition is considered not to
  have started yet, and no fixtures will be assigned the current
  color. Values between zero and one mean the transition is in
  progress, and lights whose distance measure divided by the largest
  distance measure is less than or equal to the current phase will
  change color. Once the transition phase reaches one (or greater),
  the transition is complete, and all lights will be assigned the
  color associated with the current cycle index. The default
  transition phase function, [[transition-during-down-beat]], causes
  the transition to be spread over the down beat of each bar.
  Passing [[rhythm/snapshot-bar-phase]] instead would spread the
  transition over the entire bar, so that transitions would be feeding
  right into each other. Other possibilities are limited only by your
  imagination. The transition can run backwards; it can pause or
  reverse directions multiple times; it does not even necessarily have
  to happen only once during each index value. This means that if you
  want to reverse the direction of a transition which lasts for the
  entire duration of a cycle index value, you can do it by reversing
  either the distance measure or the phase function, whichever is
  easier. (If the transition is shorter than the time over which the
  `:color-index-function` changes, you will want to reverse the
  distance measure rather than the phase function, because otherwise
  the order in which the colors appear will be strange.)

  To give your running effect a meaningful name within user
  interfaces, pass a short and descriptive value with `:effect-name`."
