  "Effects pipeline functions for working with dimmer channels for
  fixtures and heads. Dimmer effects are always tied to a _master_
  chain, which can scale back the maximum allowable value for that
  dimmer channel, as a percentage. Unless otherwise specified, the
  dimmer cue will be attached to the show grand master, but you can
  create other masters to adjust the brightness of groups of fixtures,
  perhaps because they are intrinsically brighter, or to adjust the
  balance of lighting for artistic reasons. Secondary masters can be
  chained to each other, and are always chained to the show grand
  master, so turning that down will dim the entire show; setting it to
  zero will black out the show.

  This master scaling capability is so useful that you will almost
  always want a prominent fader on a MIDI controller tied to the show
  grand master, and possibly others to secondary masters.
  [[show/add-midi-control-to-master-mapping]] makes that easy,
  especially for the grand master, and for submasters stored in show
  variables, which can be referred to by their keywords.

  Some fixtures have damping functions that slow down their dimmer
  response, so you may not get the kind of coordination you would like
  from oscillated dimmer cues. A potential workaround is to use the
  dimmer channels as a maximum brightness level to allow tweaking the
  overall brightness of an effect, and using the lightness attribute
  of a color cue to create time-varying brightness effects."
