  "Effects pipeline functions for working with dimmer channels for
  fixtures and heads. Dimmer effects are always tied to a _master_
  chain, which can scale back the maximum allowable value for that
  dimmer channel, as a percentage. Unless otherwise specified, the
  dimmer cue will be attached to the show grand master, but you can
  create other masters to adjust the brightness of groups of fixtures,
  perhaps because they are intrinsically brighter, or to adjust the
  balance of lighting for artistic reasons. Secondary masters can be
  chained to each other, and are always chained to the show grand
  master, so turning that down will dim the entire show; setting it to
  zero will black out the show.

  This master scaling capability is so useful that you will almost
  always want a prominent fader on a MIDI controller tied to the show
  grand master, and possibly others to secondary masters.
  [[show/add-midi-control-to-master-mapping]] makes that easy,
  especially for the grand master, and for submasters stored in show
  variables, which can be referred to by their keywords.

  Some fixtures have damping functions that slow down their dimmer
  response, so you may not get the kind of coordination you would like
  from oscillated dimmer cues. A potential workaround is to use the
  dimmer channels as a maximum brightness level to allow tweaking the
  overall brightness of an effect, and using the lightness attribute
  of a color cue to create time-varying brightness effects."

(defn dimmer-effect
  "Returns an effect which assigns a dynamic value to all the supplied
  dimmers. If a `true` value is passed for `:htp?`, applies
  _highest-takes-precedence_ (i.e. compares the value to the previous
  assignment for the channel, and lets the highest value remain).

  All dimmer cues are associated with a [[master]] chain which can
  scale down the values to which they are set. If none is supplied
  when creating the dimmer cue, the show's grand master is used.

  Dimmers are either a channel fully dedicated to dimming, identified
  by the channel `:type` of `:dimmer`, or a dimmer function range
  defined over only part of a multi-purpose channel, where the
  function `:type` is `:dimmer`, and the channel `:type` must be
  something else. A single head cannot have both types of dimmer,
  since a function can only exist on one channel in a given head.

  If you have any fixtures that are capable of RGB color mixing, but
  lack dedicated dimmer channels, you can have this effect simulate a
  dimmer channel for those fixtures by passing a `true` value with
  `add-virtual-dimmers?`. The virtual dimmer works by modifying any
  color effect that has already run for those fixtures, to reduce the
  brightness of the color being assigned. To do that, this dimmer
  effect needs to run at a higher effect priority than any color
  effect you want it to modify, so be sure to add it to your show with
  an appropriate priority value. Virtual dimmers are incompatible with
  hightest-takes-precedence dimming, because there is no actual
  previous dimmer value for them to work with, so you cannot use both
  `htp?` and `add-virtual-dimmers` at the same time."
