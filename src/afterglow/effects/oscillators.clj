(defn build-oscillator
  "Returns an oscillator which generates a waveform relative to the
  phase of the current beat, bar, or phrase. The shape of the wave is
  determined by the first argument, `shape-fn`.

  In the simplest case, `shape-fn` is a function that takes a single
  argument, the curent phase of the oscillator, which ranges from `0`
  to `1`, and returns what the value fo the oscillator should be at
  that phase in its waveform. The value returned by `shape-fn` must
  also range from `0` to `1`.

  If the shape of the oscillator needs to be able to change over time
  depending on the value of a [dynamic
  parameter](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/parameters.adoc#dynamic-parameters),
  then `shape-fn` will instead implement [[IVariableShape]] in order
  to be able to resolve those parameters.

  All of the standard oscillators provided by Afterglow are built in
  this way. For example, an upwards-sloping sawtooth wave would be
  created by passing a `shape-fn` that simply returns its argument:

  ```
  (build-oscillator (fn [phase] phase))
   ```

  For examples of how to generate other kinds of waveforms, view the
  source for [[sine]], [[square]], and [[triangle]].

  With no additional arguments, the waveform is defined by calling
  `shape-fn` with a phase argument that ramps upward from `0` to `1`
  over the course of each beat.

  Passing the value `:bar` or `:phrase` with the optional keyword
  argument `:interval` makes the wave cycle over a bar or phrase
  instead.

  Supplying a value with `:interval-ratio` will run the oscillator at
  the specified fraction or multiple of the chosen interval (beat,
  bar, or phrase), and supplying a `:phase` will offset the oscillator
  from the underlying metronome phase by that amount. (See the
  [documentation](https://github.com/brunchboy/afterglow/blob/master/doc/oscillators.adoc#sawtooth-oscillators)
  for an expanded explanation illustrated with graphs.)

(defn sine
  "Returns an oscillator which generates a sine wave relative to the
  phase of the current beat, bar, or phrase. With no arguments, it
  creates a sine wave that curves upward from `0` to `1` over the
  first half of each beat, then back down to `0` through the end of
  the beat.

  Passing the value `:bar` or `:phrase` with the optional keyword
  argument `:interval` makes the wave cycle over a bar or phrase
  instead.

  Supplying a value with `:interval-ratio` will run the oscillator at
  the specified fraction or multiple of th chosen interval (beat, bar,
  or phrase), and supplying a `:phase` will offset the oscillator from
  the underlying metronome phase by that amount.
