(defn chase
  "Create an effect which moves through a list of other effects based
  on the value of a `position` parameter. When `position` is `1`, the
  first effect in `effects` is used, `2` results in the second effect,
  and so on. Intermediate values produce a [[fade]] between the
  corresponding effects. The interpretation of values less than one or
  greater than the number of effects in `effects` depends on the value
  passed with the optional keyword argument `:beyond`. The default
  behavior (when `:beyond` is omitted or passed with `:blank`) is to
  treat any numbers outside the range of elements in `effects` as if
  they refer to [[blank]] effects. This makes it easy to fade into the
  first effect by having `position` grow from `0` to `1`, and to fade
  out of the last effect by having `position` grow from the number of
  elements in `effects` towards the next integer, at which point the
  final effect will be fully faded out. In this mode, when `position`
  resolves to a value less than zero, or greater than the number of
  effects in `effects` plus one, the chase will end. So a chase which
  fades in, fades between its effects, fades out, and ends, can be
  implemented by simply passing in a variable parameter for `position`
  which smoothly grows from zero as time goes on.

  Of course `position` needs to be a dynamic parameter for the chase
  to progress over time; [[build-step-param]] is designed to
  conveniently create parameters for controlling chases in time with
  the show metronome. They can also be controlled by a dial on a
  physical controller that is bound to a show variable.

  Passing a value of `:loop` with the optional keyword argument
  `:beyond` causes the chase to treat `effects` as if it was an
  infinite list of copies of itself, so once the final effect is
  reached, the chase begins fading into the first effect again, and so
  on. Similarly, if `position` drops below `1`, the chase starts
  fading in to the final effect. In this mode the chase continues
  until all of its underlying effects have ended (either on their own,
  or because they were asked to end by the operator), or `position`
  resolves to `nil`, which kills it instantly.

  Finally, passing `:bounce` with `:beyond` is similar to `:loop`,
  except that every other repetition of the list of effects is
  traversed in reverse order. In other words, if `position` keeps
  growing steadily in value, and there are three effects in `effects`,
  with a `:beyond` value of `:loop` you will see them in the order 1
  &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 1&hellip; while
  a value of `:bounce` would give you 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 2
  &rarr; 1 &rarr; 2 &rarr; 3 &rarr; 2&hellip;.

  Any element of `effects` can be a [[scene]], grouping many other
  effects, or [[blank]], which will temporarily defer to whatever else
  was happening before the chase was activated."
