# Contributing

Hi there! We're delighted that you'd like to contribute to this
project. It has been generous collaboration from people all over the
world that has made it possible so far, and your help is key to
keeping it great.

Contributions to this project are [released][contributions-released]
to the public under the [project's open source license](LICENSE).

This project adheres to the
[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][covenant].
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting started

Before you can start contributing to Afterglow, you'll need to
set up your environment. Fork and clone the repo and install
[Clojure][clojure] (for compiling and running the code) and
[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) (to manage the project dependencies
and builds). Both of these rely on having a working Java runtime; if
the mechanism you used to install them did not automatically include
one, I recommend installing a current version of the
[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net).

> Starting with version 0.2.5, you also need to have
> [Antora](https://antora.org) installed because it is used to build
> the embedded copy of the User Guide when building and running from
> source. Assuming you have a current version of `node` installed,
> simply running `npm i` inside the top level directory of the
> afterglow project will install Antora for you. If you don't have a
> node environment and are impatient to get started without getting
> one, you can temporarily comment out the section of `project.clj`
> that builds the user guide. Add `#_` to the `:prep-tasks`
> line so that it looks like this:
>
>  `  :prep-tasks [#_["shell" "npx" "antora" "--fetch" "doc/embedded.yml"`
>
> But keep in mind that if you do this, the built-in user guide will
> not work, and you will not be able to create a release-worthy build
> until you install Antora and restore the line to its un-commented
> state.

Once you have those in place, you can run Afterglow from source by
opening a terminal window inside your clone of the project, and typing
`lein repl`. You will see a bunch of output as the embedded copy of
the User Guide is generated by Antora and the images are copied in,
and then Clojure will start, with output similar to this:

    REPL-y 0.5.1, nREPL 0.8.3
    Clojure 1.10.3
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.10+9-LTS
    afterglow loaded.
    afterglow.examples=>

At that point you can follow along with the example flow on the main
project page, and start diving into exploring and changing the source
code.

Of course to do any serious work, you will want some sort of editor
with embedded REPL support, and ideally structural editing support for
Lisp s-expressions. We find [GNU Emacs][emacs] with [CIDER][cider] to
be an incredibly productive environment for Clojure work, but some of
our colleagues swear by [IntelliJ IDEA][idea] (even the free Community
Edition) with [Cursive][cursive], so use whatever IDE or editor works
best for you.

For testing you are going to want to install OLA (as described on the
main project page) and have some lighting (and possibly MIDI) hardware
to attach.

## Giving back

Once you have something working you’d like to share, you can open a
[pull request][pulls].

Or if you simply have an idea, or something that you wish worked
differently, feel free to open an [issue][issues] if it seems like
nobody already has.
